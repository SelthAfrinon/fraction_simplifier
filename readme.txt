Description: Fraction Simplifier takes a fraction numerator and denominator and reduces the fraction to its simplest form.

Inputs: -num <numerator_of_function>, -den <denominator_of_function>.

Outputs: Prints simplified fraction to screen.

Process: Takes two integers as the numerator and denominator, calculates the GCD between them, and divides the numerator and denominator by the calculated GCD.

Example input:
	fraction_simplifier -num 5 -den 15
